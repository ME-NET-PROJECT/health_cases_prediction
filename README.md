# Health Cases Prediction

This repository focuses on predicting various health cases, including mental health and respiratory conditions, using deep learning models. The project leverages time-series data to forecast health trends and provide insights into potential future cases.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models for health-related cases, helping healthcare professionals and policymakers make data-driven decisions. The models are trained on relevant datasets and evaluated based on established performance metrics.

## Applications

- **Mental Health Prediction:** Forecasting trends in mental health conditions to assist in early intervention and resource allocation.
- **Respiratory Cases Prediction:** Predicting respiratory-related cases to monitor air quality impact and public health preparedness.

## Results

The project includes visualizations of predictions over specific periods, demonstrating model performance and trends in health cases. These insights can help in planning medical resources and preventive measures.
